# Live BitMEX ETHUSD Trades

This was originally forked and adapted from: https://github.com/beastlybeast/SignificantTrades

## About
This script uses Bitmex's public trades websocket and does a few things:

1. It collapses all orders with the same timestamp into one line.
2. It allows you to filter out orders less than a particular size.
3. It highlights orders that exceed a certain size.

## How To Use
1. Then type in the symbol name (e.g. XBTUSD), the minimum order threshold (e.g. 5000), and click submit.
